Q1: 
Test Plan
Objective
    * Assure that truck's configuration against the cloud's sensor data is accurate.
Scope
    * The test will focus on the data. It will not cover on how the data will be retrieved. 
Testing Strategy
    * Since the data will not be retrieved there is no need to have integration tests. Unit tesing should be suffecient.
    * Testing should be able to support large amount of data. i.e. use `fs.readFile` instead of `fs.readFileSync`.
Test Cases
Config File = sensorMetadata.json;
Cloud File: All Cloud Sensors.json
    1. Verify that sensor name on config file matches the sensor alias on the cloud file 
        a. Verify that sensors on config file exist on the clould file
    2. Verify that name, displayName, sampleKey are the same on the config file (dependents on actual requirements)
    3. Verify the sensor units of measurement on config file matches uom on cloud file
    4. Verify  sensors on config file are active on the cloud file
    5. Verify that duplicate entries dont exist on the config file
    6. Verify that the config file and clould file does not have missing fields (depends on actual requirments)
    7. Verify that each unique sensor on config file has a unique sensor id on the cloud file.
Risks & Assumption
    * Data retrievable may be out of date. Direct retrievable will result to more up to date data.

Q1: Results:
The following sensors are missing from the cloud file:
    ['ENGINE1_AWL', 'ENGINE1_RSL', 'ENGINE1_MIL', 'ENGINE1_PRO', 'TRANS_OIL_DIFF_PRESS']


Q2: Result:
The following sensors have inaccurate unit of measurement from the cloud file:
    ['ENGINE1.HOURS.ETHO', 'DIRTY_POWER', 'POWERTRAIN1.PUMP_HHP']

Q3: Result:
    There are no duplicate sensors on the meta file.

Issues: 
    * Found sensors not existent on the cloud file and sensors with inaccurate unit of measurement.
    * Carrying an assumption that on mapping of fields: uom => unitsOfMeasurement, alias => name, name === displayName === sampleKey, sensors need to be active
    * The value of grouping, namespace, or constraints is not defined. Would a sensor on any of the two be considered invalid if thos fields are diffrent?
    * Similarly field ipcId is also not defined.
    * Why does the metaData does not have the sensorId verification by name can be risky? Name not matching becuase of case.
